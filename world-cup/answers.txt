Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, the time to complete the program was fairly consistent. As it increased, the time to complete
started increasing by factors of 10.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would stop at 10,000 simulations.
