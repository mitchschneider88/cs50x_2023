If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

If songs.db contained the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, I would characterize their audio aura as a energetic and on the dark side.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

The average of the energy, valence, and danceability may not be the best way to calculate the audio aura of a listener. The energy, valence, and
danceability of each song should be weighted by how often the listener listened to the song.
